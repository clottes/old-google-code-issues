This repository exists just to keep the old issues migrated from our old project home on Google Code.  
Please do not submit a new issue or add comments to existing issues and contribute to [the new repositories](https://github.com/mybatis) instead.

And if you have a question, please use the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/mybatis-user).
We use GitHub Issues only to track bugs and feature requests.

Thank you!
